	  if needed
	- mask special chars in memoblobs (sql output)
	- use delimeter char for fields if they contain a line break (csv output)

	  and not unique(field1), unique(field2), ...
	- fixed various memory leaks
	- fixed many compiler warnings
	- configure checks for PX_timestamp2string() to ensure pxlib >= 0.4.3
	  is present

	- fixed reading and outputting timestamps, uses the new function
	  PX_timestamp2string() of pxlib >= 0.4.3

Version 0.2.2
	- No need to specify a blob file if all blobs are contained in the
	  db file.
	- Use PX_get_data_blob()

	- sql type for time and timestamp can be both set on the command line

Version 0.2.1
